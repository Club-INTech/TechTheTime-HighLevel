Distances are in mm and angles in radian

===== TEAM YELLOW =====


The key point are point (x,y) to reach before to do the rotateABS adequate et the moveABS adequate

Key point (x,y) :

- The point to drop and take statue/replic : (421.43,1704)
    Distrib camp side :
    - The point to take blue palet of the distrib verti on the camp side : (144.29+RADIUS_BASE_1A+10,1250-115)
    - The point to take green palet of the distrib verti on the camp side : (144.29+RADIUS_BASE_1A+10,1250)
    - The point to take red palet of the distrib verti on the camp side : (144.29+RADIUS_BASE_1A+10,1250+115)


Key angle ABS :

    - The angle abs to take statue : 3*pi/4
    - The angle to drop replic : -3*pi/4
    - The angle to take distrib camp side : pi
    - To take
The key distance are the distance of the robot to do when he have the adequate angle

Key distance ABS :

    - To take statue : 170-HAFL_LENGHT_2A 
    - To drop statue : 170-HAFL_LENGHT_2A
    Distrib camp side:
    - To take blue : 95
    - To take green : 77
