This is the high level code for the autonomic robot designed to participate in Erobot2022 robotics cup. It is developed using ROS2(foxy) and has 5 nodes\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item microcontroller\+\_\+proxy 
\item manager 
\item robot\+\_\+vision 
\item motion\+\_\+control 
\item urg\+\_\+node 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each node is represented by doxygen module. Each class contains a reference back to its module/node.

You have the brief description and the reference to each node below.\hypertarget{index_intro1}{}\doxysubsection{microcontroller\+\_\+proxy}\label{index_intro1}
microcontroller\+\_\+proxy node is used to ineteract with microcontroller. It treats orders coming from other nodes and then transforms them and sends them to the microcontroller. In the case of motion orders, it provides a feedback from the microcontroller.

Link to the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__microcontroller__proxy}{Microcontroller node.}}\hypertarget{index_intro2}{}\doxysubsection{manager}\label{index_intro2}
manager node is responsible for the orders distribution and robot\textquotesingle{}s position tracking. It sends data to the motion\+\_\+control node and requests robot\+\_\+vision and microcontroller\+\_\+proxy nodes to execute some orders. It takes the user action script as input.

Link to the \mbox{\hyperlink{group__manager}{Manager node.}}\hypertarget{index_intro3}{}\doxysubsection{robot\+\_\+vision}\label{index_intro3}
robot\+\_\+vision is responsible for image processing, distance measuring and aruco tag scanning. It receives requests from manager.\hypertarget{index_motion_control}{}\doxysubsection{motion\+\_\+control}\label{index_motion_control}
motion\+\_\+control is responsible for area scanning, path finding and sending basic orders to the microcontroller\+\_\+proxy node.\hypertarget{index_urg_node}{}\doxysubsection{urg\+\_\+node}\label{index_urg_node}
urg\+\_\+node is a default ROS2 node, which publishes the points data of lidar.
